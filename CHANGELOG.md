### Fix: remove unnecessary StatusBarController recreation on wake (v1.0.10)

**Symptom observed (Apr 6 2026):**
After connecting an external monitor and rearranging displays, the system log showed
recurring `[BSBlockSentinel:FBSWorkspaceScenesClient] failed!` errors from the BaseBoard
framework. These appeared immediately after the display reconfiguration event and then
continued at ~10-minute intervals, suggesting the ControlCenter scene for the status bar
item was failing to reconnect after being torn down.

**Root cause analysis:**
`systemDidWake` was recreating the entire `StatusBarController` (and therefore a new
`NSStatusItem`) on every wake. The original justification (PR #2, Mar 28 2026) was that
"NSStatusItem can become invalid after a long overnight sleep". However:

1. On modern macOS, `NSStatusItem` is retained and managed by ControlCenter across
   sleep/wake cycles — it does not become invalid.
2. The actual post-sleep crash (PR #3, Apr 3 2026) was caused by `NetworkMonitor`'s stale
   `previousTime` causing a UInt64 overflow, and was already fixed by calling `reset()` in
   `StatsPoller.start()`.
3. Recreating `NSStatusItem` during an already-unstable window (display reconfiguration,
   system wake) tears down the active ControlCenter scene and requests a new one, which
   times out → `BSBlockSentinel` failures.

**Hypothesis:**
The `StatusBarController` recreation was never necessary and was masking the real fix
(monitor state reset). Removing it eliminates the scene churn and the `BSBlockSentinel`
errors. If the status bar item ever genuinely disappears after a long sleep in a future
macOS version, that would need a targeted investigation rather than a blanket recreation.

**Change:**
`systemDidWake` now only restarts the poller (which already calls `cpuMonitor.reset()` and
`networkMonitor.reset()` internally). No `StatusBarController` recreation. No display
change notification handler needed — ControlCenter repositions status items automatically
when display topology changes.
